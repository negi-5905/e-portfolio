  <div class="card-content">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12">
        <span class="card-title teal-text">5. A failure you've learned from</span>

        </div>
        <div class="answer-text">
          <p>Early in my career at Zhiffy, I underestimated the complexity of scaling our e-commerce platform. I initially designed a database structure that worked perfectly during testing but began to show serious performance issues when we onboarded more vendors and products. Response times increased dramatically, affecting user experience.</p>
          
          <p>Rather than acknowledging the issue immediately, I spent too much time trying to optimize the existing structure with minor tweaks, reluctant to admit that my initial design had fundamental flaws. This delayed the proper solution and created more work for the team.</p>
          
          <p>Eventually, I had to step back and completely rethink our database design and query patterns. After implementing these changes, we achieved a 20% improvement in response time. This experience taught me three valuable lessons: first, to design with scale in mind from the beginning; second, to be humble enough to recognize when a foundational approach needs revision; and third, to seek input from more experienced colleagues earlier in the process. I now approach system design with much more consideration for future growth and am more open to pivoting quickly when data suggests my approach isn't optimal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer-text">
          <p><strong>Technical Problem Solving:</strong> At Meditab, I designed a customized algorithm that optimized drug dispenser robots, reducing cycle-time by 25%. This required deep analysis of the existing system and creative thinking to develop a solution that separated drugs into distinct groups for maximum concurrent execution.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Throughout my career, I've worked across various domains—from e-commerce at Zhiffy to healthcare automation at Meditab to IoT applications at Mtag Innovations. Each role required learning new business contexts and technologies, which I accomplished quickly to deliver effective solutions.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> I have consistently improved system performance in my roles. At Zhiffy, I refactored the codebase and optimized database queries to improve response time by 20%. Similarly, I increased the speed of a video analytics application at Meditab by 20% by implementing customized YOLOv3 and DeepSORT algorithms.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Full-Stack Development:</strong> I'm comfortable working across the entire technology stack. At Mtag, I developed both backend systems using Flask and frontend interfaces with JavaScript. This versatility allows me to understand how changes in one part of the system affect others.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer-text">
          <p><strong>Documentation:</strong> I sometimes get caught up in solving technical problems and neglect thorough documentation. I've recognized this weakness and now set aside dedicated time after implementing features to document my code and design decisions. I've also adopted tools like Swagger for API documentation to make this process more structured.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Delegation:</strong> As someone who enjoys solving technical challenges, I've had a tendency to take on too many tasks myself rather than delegating effectively. I'm addressing this by consciously identifying opportunities to involve team members based on their strengths and providing clear requirements and context when assigning tasks.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Public Speaking:</strong> While I'm comfortable in small team discussions, I've found presenting to larger audiences challenging.

          <p>At Zhiffy, I developed the backend for an e-commerce platform, building over 50 RESTful APIs and improving system response time by 20% through database optimization. Before that, at Meditab, I worked on optimization algorithms for pharmaceutical automation systems, reducing cycle time by 25% and developing a video analytics application using computer vision to track humans in multi-camera environments.</p>
          
          <p>My technical expertise spans backend development with Python and Flask, database design and optimization with MongoDB, computer vision applications using OpenCV and deep learning frameworks, and algorithmic optimization for complex systems.</p>
          
          <p>I approach problems methodically, breaking them down into manageable components while keeping sight of the larger goal. This approach served me well at Mtag Innovations, where I developed a cloud-based web application for monitoring drug storage conditions—a system that required careful integration of IoT sensors, data processing, and user interface design.</p>
          
          <p>Beyond technical skills, I value clear communication and collaboration. I believe the best solutions emerge when diverse perspectives are brought together, and I strive to foster environments where ideas can be openly shared and refined.</p>
          
          <p>Outside of work, I'm active in the local tech community, participate in competitive programming challenges, and enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and photography. I'm also passionate about mentoring aspiring developers, helping them bridge the gap between academic learning and industry applications.</p>
          
          <p>I'm driven by continuous learning and the opportunity to apply technology to solve meaningful problems. Throughout my career, I've found that the most rewarding projects are those that not only overcome technical challenges but also deliver tangible benefits to users and organizations.</p>

              "Dead Poets Society" is a profound exploration of individualism, tradition, and the transformative power 
              of literature. Set in the prestigious Welton Academy in 1959, the film follows an English teacher, 
              John Keating (Robin Williams), who inspires his students through his unorthodox teaching methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Williams delivers one of his most nuanced performances, balancing his natural charisma with restraint and 
              depth. The young ensemble cast, particularly Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard, provide authentic 
              portrayals of adolescents discovering their voices in a conformist environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Director Peter Weir masterfully captures both the austere beauty of the academy and the awakening 
              spirits of the students. The cinematography by John Seale creates a visual poetry that mirrors the 
              film's literary themes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The film's most enduring legacy lies in its celebration of language, poetry, and independent thought. 
              Keating's exhortation to "seize the day" and his metaphor of "standing on desks" to see the world 
              differently have become cultural touchstones.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the third act takes dramatic turns that may feel heightened to some viewers, the emotional core 
              remains authentic. The final scene, with its simple yet powerful gesture of rebellion and respect, 
              ranks among cinema's most moving endings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over three decades later, "Dead Poets Society" remains a timeless reminder of education's true purpose: 
              not to fill minds with facts, but to teach students to think for themselves and, in Keating's words, 
              "make their lives extraordinary."
